Multi-Instance Learning for Sparsely Labelled Data
================================================

Sean Noran(<snoran@umass.edu>)

Overview
--------

In this work, we demonstrate that Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) can be applied to
various time-domain datasets, in order to reduce the need for fine-grained labels.
We examine various MIL algorithms.

Installation
------------

TODO: Add installation instructions (see misvm, miforest)

...

or by running the setup file manually

    git clone [ url for MIL ]
    cd MIL
    python setup.py install

misvm depends on the following packages. (see TODO: add link to misvm)

 + [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/): Library for efficient matrix math in Python
 + [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/): Library for more MATLAB-like functionality
 + [CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/): Efficient convex (including quadratic program) optimization
